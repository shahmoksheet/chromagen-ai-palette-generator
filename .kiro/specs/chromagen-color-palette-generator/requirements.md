# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ChromaGen is a generative AI-powered color palette creation tool designed to streamline the design workflow while ensuring accessibility compliance. The platform transforms natural language prompts and inspirational images into complete, ready-to-use design palettes that meet WCAG accessibility standards. This tool addresses the time-consuming challenge of creating aesthetically beautiful, harmonious, and accessible color palettes for designers and developers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Modal Input System

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to generate color palettes using either text descriptions or uploaded images, so that I can quickly translate my creative vision into actionable color schemes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a text prompt (e.g., "energetic palette for fitness brand inspired by tropical sunset") THEN the system SHALL generate a harmonious color palette based on the description
2. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL extract the core color scheme and generate a complementary palette
3. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and guidance
4. IF the uploaded image exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL compress or reject the image with appropriate feedback

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Color Generation Engine

**User Story:** As a creative professional, I want an intelligent system that understands context and generates harmonious color combinations, so that I can focus on design rather than manual color theory calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt is processed THEN the system SHALL generate 5-7 contextually appropriate colors
2. WHEN colors are generated THEN they SHALL follow established color harmony principles (complementary, triadic, analogous, etc.)
3. WHEN generating palettes THEN the system SHALL provide reasoning for color choices to educate users
4. IF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback palettes with explanations

### Requirement 3: Structured Palette Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want color palettes organized into clear categories with multiple format options, so that I can easily implement them in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a palette is generated THEN colors SHALL be categorized as primary, secondary, and accent colors
2. WHEN displaying colors THEN each color SHALL show HEX, RGB, and HSL values
3. WHEN a user clicks on a color value THEN it SHALL be copied to clipboard automatically
4. WHEN viewing palettes THEN users SHALL see color names and usage recommendations

### Requirement 4: Automated Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a UX designer, I want automatic accessibility checking for my color palettes, so that I can ensure my designs are inclusive without manual testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a palette is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically check WCAG contrast ratios (AA and AAA levels)
2. WHEN accessibility issues are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic color combinations
3. WHEN viewing palettes THEN users SHALL see color-blindness simulation views (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia)
4. IF contrast ratios are insufficient THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative colors that meet standards

### Requirement 5: Export and Integration Features

**User Story:** As a designer working across multiple tools, I want flexible export options for my color palettes, so that I can seamlessly integrate them into my existing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to export THEN the system SHALL provide dropdown options for multiple formats (CSS, SCSS, JSON, Adobe ASE, Sketch)
2. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include color values, names, and usage guidelines
3. WHEN generating exports THEN the system SHALL maintain color accuracy across formats
4. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative download options

### Requirement 6: Palette History and Management

**User Story:** As a designer working on multiple projects, I want to save and revisit my generated palettes, so that I can maintain consistency across my work and iterate on previous designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a palette is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically save it to user history
2. WHEN viewing history THEN users SHALL see thumbnails, creation dates, and original prompts
3. WHEN selecting a saved palette THEN users SHALL be able to regenerate variations or export
4. WHEN history reaches storage limits THEN the system SHALL archive oldest entries with user notification

### Requirement 7: Clean and Intuitive User Interface

**User Story:** As a user new to color theory, I want a clutter-free, easy-to-navigate interface with clear explanations, so that I can efficiently create palettes while learning about color design principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the application THEN they SHALL see a minimal, clean interface with clear navigation
2. WHEN interacting with features THEN users SHALL receive contextual explanations for color choices and accessibility decisions
3. WHEN viewing palettes THEN the interface SHALL prioritize visual clarity and easy color comparison
4. IF users need help THEN tooltips and guidance SHALL be readily available without cluttering the interface

### Requirement 8: API Key Management and Security

**User Story:** As a developer deploying ChromaGen, I want secure API key management, so that I can protect sensitive credentials while maintaining functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN API keys SHALL be stored securely using environment variables
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN keys SHALL never be exposed in client-side code
3. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and inform users
4. IF API keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 9: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user working under tight deadlines, I want fast palette generation and responsive interactions, so that I can maintain my creative flow without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating palettes THEN the system SHALL complete processing within 3 seconds for text prompts
2. WHEN uploading images THEN processing SHALL complete within 5 seconds for standard image sizes
3. WHEN the system is processing THEN users SHALL see clear loading indicators with progress feedback
4. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN users SHALL receive status updates and estimated completion times
